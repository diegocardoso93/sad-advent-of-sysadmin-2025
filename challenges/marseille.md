## 📝 Description

As the Christmas shopping season approaches, the security team has asked Mary and John to implement more security measures. Unfortunately, this time they have broken the LAMP stack; the frontend is unable to get an answer from upstream, thus they need your help again to fix it.

The application should be able to serve the content from the webserver.

> **Note for Pro users:** Direct SSH access is not available (yet) for this scenario.

## ✅ Test

* `curl localhost | head -n1` returns `SadServers - LAMP Stack`

The "Check My Solution" button runs the script `/home/admin/agent/check.sh`, which you can see and execute.
