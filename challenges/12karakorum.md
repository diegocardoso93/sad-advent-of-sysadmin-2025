### Description

(NOTE: this is not a new scenario but an existing Pro one temporarily available to all users as the last Advent of SysAdmin 2025 scenario).

There's a binary at /home/admin/wtfit that nobody knows how it works or what it does ("what the fun is this"). Someone remembers something about wtfit needing to communicate to a service in order to start.

Run this wtfit program so it doesn't exit with an error, fixing or working around things that you need but are broken in this server.

### Test

Running /home/admin/wtfit returns OK.
